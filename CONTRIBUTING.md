# Contributing to LangAgentMail

LangAgentMail is developed as a **live case study** exploring whether a UNIX expert with deep experience in internet infrastructure — including virtualization, DNS, email routing, databases, and minimal web design — can leverage ChatGPT to create a functional system around advanced, civic-relevant use cases.

The project is purposefully constrained to test AI-augmented engineering workflows. It is **not** an open-source free-for-all — not yet. Before `v1.0.0`, all contributions are limited to:

- Expert critiques
- Observational feedback
- Alternative phrasing or naming proposals
- Broader discussion of use cases, goals, and future viability
- Community support through awareness and visibility

**We welcome public analysis. We do not yet welcome pull requests.**

## Development Accounts and Email Aliases

The following system-level accounts and aliases are being configured on the development node `ai.cook-il.us`:

- `aiagent@cook-il.us` — system identity for outbound automation
- `info@cook-il.us` — public-facing communication alias
- `webmaster@cook-il.us`
- `postmaster@cook-il.us`
- `abuse@cook-il.us`
- All relevant [RFC 2142](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2142.txt) aliases

These aliases will be monitored and **selectively opened to contributors**, particularly those interested in replicating the model in other counties, municipalities, or states. Contributors who engage will gain insight not just into the message routing, but into its purpose as a **template for civic-grade digital infrastructure**.

## Philosophy and Timing

LangAgentMail is **not against profit** or commercial viability. Its early constraint on contribution is **not rooted in ideology, gatekeeping, or arrogance**. It reflects a deliberate strategy:

- To avoid premature external dependency
- To allow foundational decisions to emerge from real-world constraints
- To give the architecture time to mature before scaling participation

Your advice and insights are welcome. Your code and pull requests will be welcomed after v1.0.0 — not before.
