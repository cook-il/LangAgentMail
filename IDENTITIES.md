## ðŸ“Œ Reserved Identity: law@cook-il.us

**Label:** `law@cook-il.us`  
**Status:** Unassigned  
**Purpose:** To act as the controlling identity behind the `abuse@cook-il.us` alias, ideally operated by a qualified legal actor (lawyer, law firm, or independent compliance officer).

**Current State:**  
- No mailbox or system account has been created.  
- No PGP or SSH keys assigned.  
- Not mapped to `abuse@cook-il.us` (yet).  
- No implementation decisions have been made.  

**Tracking Tag:** `langagent/abuse/identity/law-unassigned`

### Discussion

The designation of `law@cook-il.us` remains **unassigned by design**, reflecting the legal and operational complexity of assigning authority over the `abuse@cook-il.us` alias. While `info@` and `aiagent@` are internally governed and tied to infrastructure ownership, `abuse@` must carry legal weight and impartiality.

Assigning a single identity like `law@cook-il.us` risks oversimplifying the necessary distinctions between:

- **State law** (Illinois-specific ordinances or administrative law)
- **Federal law** (FTC, FCC, and constitutional matters)
- **Specialized law** (e.g., digital rights, consumer protection, civil rights)
- **Segment law** (niche or emerging areas, such as zoning automation or AI-generated records)

A future legal structure may need to differentiate between:

- `state-law@cook-il.us`
- `federal-law@cook-il.us`
- `privacy-law@cook-il.us`
- `zoning-law@cook-il.us`
- `audit@cook-il.us` (internal or ombudsman role)

These cannot be prematurely collapsed under `law@`, which currently represents an **unassigned legal root**. Its placeholder status allows the project to:

- Invite legal critique without presuming jurisdictional scope
- Maintain RFC compliance via `abuse@`, without violating ethical boundaries
- Delay implementation until the role can be filled by a person or organization that understands and accepts the structural responsibility

**Until such time**, `law@cook-il.us` exists as a reserved namespace, acknowledged but not active.
