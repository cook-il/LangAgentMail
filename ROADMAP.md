## 🗺️ Project Roadmap

LangAgentMail follows a deliberate versioning plan tied to infrastructure, identity, and response capabilities.

### ✅ v0.0.9 — Infrastructure Milestone (Done)
- RFC-compliant DNS + mail routing (BIND, SPF, DKIM, DMARC)
- Working dual-stack IPv4/IPv6 with TCP/UDP
- SMTP relay via YunoHost with trusted domain/IPs
- PGP identity + SSH-secured GitHub deploys
- Signed commits and echo replies via info@cook-il.us
- `.env`-based credential management
- Virtualenv setup with reproducible `requirements.txt`

---

### ✅ v0.1.1 — Message Ingestion and HTML Sanitization (Done)
- IMAP polling using unseen filter
- SQLite-backed queue (`mailstore.db`) with message metadata
- Normalization pipeline: strip HTML/CSS/JS, decode safely
- Persistent status tracking (`pending`, `processed`)
- Message preview and state updates via `post_process.py`

---

### 🟡 v0.1.2 — Command-aware Responses (Current)
- Free-form command parsing (e.g. `/status`, `/help`)
- Improved formatting of AI replies (clear prompts, inline context)
- Reply only to verified domains or whitelisted senders
- Internal logging with source timestamps for traceability

---

### 🔜 v0.1.3 — Archival and Grouping
- Archive processed messages by sender or domain
- SQLite schema migration for labeling/tags
- Manual export/review options for flagged content

---

### 🧠 v0.2.x — LangChain Integration
- Transition from echo bot to document-aware agent
- Embed select local documents per sender or query
- Use LangChain + OpenAIEmbeddings (or local alternative)
- Add `/ask`, `/query`, and `/resume` commands

---

### 🧠 v0.2.x — LangChain Integration
- Embedding via OpenAI or self-hosted LLMs
- Query classification and memory-aware replies
- Context chaining across multi-turn instructions
- Publicly queryable conversation snapshots (optional)

---

### 🔐 v0.3.x — Audit & Access Layer
- Cryptographically verifiable message logs
- Optional GPG key pinning for inbound messages
- Role-based controls for subdomain users
- API gateway compatibility for non-email access

---

### 🎯 v1.0.0 — First Civic-Ready Release
- Full CLI/web onboarding flow
- Exportable identity + deployment package
- Localized models (optional)
- Tested compatibility with multiple subdomains and isolated agents

---

### 🔁 Deferred Items

- **Signed commits and echo replies via `info@cook-il.us`**  
  Status: **Deferred**  
  Reason: PGP signing works in Roundcube for webmail, but not yet implemented for automated replies from `aiagent` or non-interactive scripts.  
  Will be reinstated once LangAgentMail reply automation is finalized and GPG integration extended to backend processes.
